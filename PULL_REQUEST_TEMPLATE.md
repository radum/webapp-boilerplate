**Before submitting a pull request,** please make sure the following is done:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `develop`.
2. Run `npm i` in the repository root.
3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, would be great if you add tests!
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`). Tip: `npm test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.
5. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).
6. Make sure your code lints (`npm run dev:lint`).
